My Reasons for Choosing my Approach

I chose this version of the Ring Algorithm because it strikes a balance between simplicity and efficiency while still following the core principles of leader election in distributed systems.
- Simple and Easy to Understand: Instead of complex message passing, I check the highest active process ID directly. This makes the system easier to build, debug, and maintain.
- Efficient Leader Election: When a coordinator crashes, the system quickly finds the highest active process to take over, reducing delays and keeping things running smoothly.
- Handles Failures Gracefully: If a process crashes, the system automatically detects it and starts a new election, ensuring reliability without unnecessary complexity.
- Practical for Small to Medium Systems: While larger systems may benefit from explicit message passing, this approach keeps things lightweight and effective for smaller distributed environments.

This method keeps the essence of the Ring Algorithm intact while making it more practical and easier to implement. It ensures fault tolerance and efficient coordination without unnecessary overhead.

KEY CONCEPTS
- Logical Ring Structure
- Processes are arranged in a circular (ring-like) fashion.
- Each process knows only its next neighbor in the ring.

Leader Election
- If a process detects that the coordinator has failed, it starts an election.
- The election message is passed around the ring from one process to the next.


Election Process
- The process initiating the election sends a message containing its own ID.
- Each process forwards the message but replaces the ID if it finds a process with a higher ID.
- When the message completes a full circle and returns to the initiator, the highest ID found is the new coordinator.
- The new coordinator announces itself to all processes.

Advantages of the Ring Algorithm
- No centralized control: Any process can initiate an election.
- Efficient in small systems: Only active processes participate.
- Guaranteed leader election: The highest active process always becomes the leader.

For Example
- 5 processes (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) in a ring.
- P5 is the coordinator (highest ID).
- If P5 crashes, P2 detects it and starts an election.
- P2 sends an election message → P3 → P4 → (P5 is down) → P1 → back to P2.
- The highest ID found (P4) becomes the new coordinator.
